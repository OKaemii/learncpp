functions - reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job

this is mostly used to modularize our code.

function call - an expression that tells CPU to interrupt current function, and calls another function till its end, and return to original function.

example of a user defined function:

return-type identifier() // identifier replaced with the name of your function  
{  
// Your code here  
}  

no limit on the amount of times a function might be called, nor a function calling a different or the same function.

nested functions is where line drawn. No functions to be defined in another function.
