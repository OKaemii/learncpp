# things to note
it's more useful to compile with:  
g++ [-g] -std=c++17 -Wall -Weffc++ -Wsign-conversion -Wextra -Werror file_1.cpp file_2.cpp -o output

best to have as much information as possible when dealing with either potential problems or immediate.

# basics
- a statement is an instruction that performs an action
- a function is a block of statements, generally with the intention of completing a given task indicated by the function name
- you must have a main function in cpp, and its first statement is carried out first
- every statement must end with a semicolon(;)
- a syntax error is a compiler error that occurs at compile-time when your program violates the grammar rules of the C++ language
- a library is a modular file; a collection of precompiled code that has been packaged together for reuse
- single line comment with a double forward slash
- multi-line comments with a forward slash asterisk, and end with asterisk forward slash
